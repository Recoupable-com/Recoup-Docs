# Getting Started with Recoup API

Welcome to the Recoup API documentation. This API allows you to access and analyze social media data for artists, including their fans and posts across various platforms.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```bash
https://api.recoupable.com/api
```

## 🔑 API Keys

To access the Recoup API programmatically, you'll need to create an API key. This section provides a step-by-step guide to get your API key up and running.

### Step 1: Access the API Keys Management Page

1. Navigate to the [Recoup API Keys Management Page](https://chat.recoupable.com/keys)
2. Sign in with your account if you haven't already

### Step 2: Create Your API Key

1. On the API Keys page, you'll see a form to create a new API key
2. Enter a descriptive name for your API key (e.g., "My Development Key", "Production API Key")
3. Click the "Create API Key" button
4. **Important**: Copy and securely store your API key immediately - it will only be shown once!

### Step 3: Use Your API Key

Once you have your API key, you can use it to authenticate your requests to the Recoup API. Include the API key in the `x-api-key` header for all authenticated requests:

:::code-group

```bash [cURL]
curl -X GET "https://api.recoupable.com/api/fans?artist_account_id=YOUR_ARTIST_ACCOUNT_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python [Python]
import requests

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.recoupable.com/api/fans",
    params={"artist_account_id": "YOUR_ARTIST_ACCOUNT_ID"},
    headers=headers
)
```

```javascript [JavaScript]
const response = await fetch(
  "https://api.recoupable.com/api/fans?artist_account_id=YOUR_ARTIST_ACCOUNT_ID",
  {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    },
  }
);
```

```typescript [TypeScript]
const response = await fetch(
  "https://api.recoupable.com/api/fans?artist_account_id=YOUR_ARTIST_ACCOUNT_ID",
  {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    },
  }
);
```
